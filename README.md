# LOGANALYZER - Elasticsearch Data Updater

## Getting started with this tool
This tool works with LOGANALYZER and SpringLogsGenerator repositories. It sends data from SpringLogsGenerator tool to Elasticsearch using Java ES Client (helped by Spring Data). Just provide this tool the required content (log.txt file at root directory), modify the model, service and repository properly and run the application.
